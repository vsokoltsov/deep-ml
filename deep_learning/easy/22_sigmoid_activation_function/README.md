# Sigmoid Activation Function Understanding

Write a Python function that computes the output of the sigmoid activation function given an input value z. The function should return the output rounded to four decimal places.

## Example

### Input

```
z = 0
```

### Output

```
0.5
```

### Reasoning

The sigmoid function is defined as $\sigma(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))$. For z = 0, exp(-0) = 1, hence the output is 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5.

## Understanding the Sigmoid Activation Function

The sigmoid activation function is crucial in neural networks, especially for binary classification tasks. It maps any real-valued number into the interval ( (0, 1) ), making it useful for modeling probability as an output.

### Mathematical Definition

The sigmoid function is mathematically defined as:

$$
\huge \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} 
$$

where `z` is the input to the function

### Characteristics

* Output range: The output is always between 0 and 1.
* Shape: The function has an "S" shaped curve
* Gradient: The gradient is highest near (`z = 0`) and decreases as `z` moves away from 0 in either direction
